Description: This program will;
11.1 - Create struct "Student" then create and display and array of "Student"'s
11.2 - Create struct "Employee" then create and array and display "Employee" with highest and lowest
salary using both direct access and pointer arithmetic.
11.3 - Create struct "Product" then create and array user pointers to display all "Products", display
highest stock value, and allow the user to update the quantity of any product by ProductID
11.4 - Create two structs with the same members in different orders, and demonstrate how the order
of members in the definition may affect the memory layout due to "padding". Then disable padding for the
two structs and re-display their memory sizes.
